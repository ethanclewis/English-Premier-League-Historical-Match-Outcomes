# English-Premier-League-Historical-Match-Outcomes
Graduate project for "MATH 540 - Statistical Learning I" at the College of Charleston.

Project details the process of fitting, selecting, and comparing a variety of models aimed at predicting the probability of an English Premier League home team victory for a given match using historical match data spanning the 2000/01 to 2022/23 seasons. 

In addition to creating test sets for each individual season to track our models’ accuracy over the English Premier League’s history, we also constructed a COVID-19 test set which contains all matches played ‘behind closed doors’ from June 20, 2020 to May 17, 2021 to see if our models perform worse when matches are essentially played at a neutral site without ‘home field advantage’. 

Data cleaning performed using pandas. 

Statistical analysis and visualizations perfromed in R.
